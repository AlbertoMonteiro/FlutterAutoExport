# Flutter Auto Export

A new Flutter package that allows you to auto export types globally.

## Getting Started

To use auto export feature, you just need to add the `@AutoExporter()` annotation to your class that you want to be automatically exported in the `lib/auto_export.dart` file.

Then in your other files, you just need to import the `auto_export.dart` file to have access to all auto exported files
